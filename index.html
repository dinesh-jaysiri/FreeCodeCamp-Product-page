            and exposes it for other contracts to access. It is fine if you do
            not understand everything right now, we will go into more details

          The first line tells you that the source code is licensed under the
          GPL version 3.0. Machine-readable license specifiers are important in
          a setting where publishing the source code is the default.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next line specifies that the source code is written for Solidity
          version 0.4.16, or a newer version of the language up to, but not
          including version 0.9.0. This is to ensure that the contract is not
          compilable with a new (breaking) compiler version, where it could
          behave differently. Pragmas are common instructions for compilers
          about how to treat the source code (e.g. pragma once).
        </p>
        <p>
          A contract in the sense of Solidity is a collection of code (its
          functions) and data (its state) that resides at a specific address on
          the Ethereum blockchain. The line
          <code class="code--inline">uint storedData;</code> declares a state
          variable called <code class="code--inline">storedData</code> of type
          <code class="code--inline">uint</code> (unsigned integer of 256 bits).
          You can think of it as a single slot in a database that you can query
          and alter by calling functions of the code that manages the database.
          In this example, the contract defines the functions
          <code class="code--inline">set</code> and
          <code class="code--inline">get</code> that can be used to modify or
          retrieve the value of the variable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To access a member (like a state variable) of the current contract,
          you do not typically add the <code class="code--inline">this</code>.
          prefix, you just access it directly via its name. Unlike in some other
          languages, omitting it is not just a matter of style, it results in a
          completely different way to access the member, but more on this later.
        </p>
        <p>
          This contract does not do much yet apart from (due to the
          infrastructure built by Ethereum) allowing anyone to store a single
          number that is accessible by anyone in the world without a (feasible)
          way to prevent you from publishing this number. Anyone could call
          <code class="code--inline">set</code> again with a different value and
          overwrite your number, but the number is still stored in the history
          of the blockchain. Later, you will see how you can impose access
          restrictions so that only you can alter the number.

            Blockchains as a concept are not too hard to understand for
            programmers. The reason is that most of the complications (mining,
            hashing, elliptic-curve cryptography, peer-to-peer networks, etc.)
            are just there to provide a certain set of features and promises for
            the platform. Once you accept these features as given, you do not
            have to worry about the underlying technology - or do you have to
            know how Amazon’s AWS works internally in order to use it?

        <article>
          <p>
            A blockchain is a globally shared, transactional database. This
            means that everyone can read entries in the database just by
            participating in the network. If you want to change something in the
            database, you have to create a so-called transaction which has to be
            accepted by all others. The word transaction implies that the change
            you want to make (assume you want to change two values at the same
            time) is either not done at all or completely applied. Furthermore,
            while your transaction is being applied to the database, no other
            transaction can alter it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an example, imagine a table that lists the balances of all
            accounts in an electronic currency. If a transfer from one account
            to another is requested, the transactional nature of the database
            ensures that if the amount is subtracted from one account, it is
            always added to the other account. If due to whatever reason, adding
            the amount to the target account is not possible, the source account
            is also not modified.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, a transaction is always cryptographically signed by the
            sender (creator). This makes it straightforward to guard access to
            specific modifications of the database. In the example of the
            electronic currency, a simple check ensures that only the person
            holding the keys to the account can transfer money from it.

            One major obstacle to overcome is what (in Bitcoin terms) is called a “double-spend attack”: What happens if two transactions exist in the network that both want to empty an account? Only one of the transactions can be valid, typically the one that is accepted first. The problem is that “first” is not an objective term in a peer-to-peer network.

            The Ethereum Virtual Machine or EVM is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It is not only sandboxed but actually completely isolated, which means that code running inside the EVM has no access to network, filesystem or other processes. Smart contracts even have limited access to other smart contracts.

        <header class="main-section__heading">Gas</header>
        <article>
          <p>
            Upon creation, each transaction is charged with a certain amount of gas that has to be paid for by the originator of the transaction (<code class="code--inline">tx.origin</code>). While the EVM executes the transaction, the gas is gradually depleted according to specific rules. If the gas is used up at any point (i.e. it would be negative), an out-of-gas exception is triggered, which ends execution and reverts all modifications made to the state in the current call frame.

        <article>
          <p>
            The instruction set of the EVM is kept minimal in order to avoid incorrect or inconsistent implementations which could cause consensus problems. All instructions operate on the basic data type, 256-bit words or on slices of memory (or other byte arrays). The usual arithmetic, bit, logical and comparison operations are present. Conditional and unconditional jumps are possible. Furthermore, contracts can access relevant properties of the current block like its number and timestamp.

        <article>
          <p>
            Contracts can call other contracts or send Ether to non-contract accounts by the means of message calls. Message calls are similar to transactions, in that they have a source, a target, data payload, Ether, gas and return data. In fact, every transaction consists of a top-level message call which in turn can create further message calls.

        <article>
          <p>
            There is a small set of contract addresses that are special: The address range between 1 and (including) 8 contains “precompiled contracts” that can be called as any other contract but their behaviour (and their gas consumption) is not defined by EVM code stored at that address (they do not contain code) but instead is implemented in the EVM execution environment itself.
